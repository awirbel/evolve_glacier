## Hilltest 

This folder contains the files to run the hilltest for configuration ii. 

The standard setup is a Crank-Nicholson time discretization and SUPG stabilisation in space. 
However, if you want to test the other spatial stabilisation schemes (CIP, BR, SOLD, DG) checkout the different moving_surface_StabilisAtionabbreviation.py files.
